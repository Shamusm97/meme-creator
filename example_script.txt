Peter: Hey Stewie, what are you working on in there?
Stewie: Oh, just a small matter of world domination, nothing too serious.
Peter: World domination? That sounds complicated. Can I help?
Stewie: Help? You can barely operate a can opener, Peter.
Peter: Hey, that can opener was defective! The instructions were unclear.
Stewie: The instructions were "turn handle counterclockwise."
Peter: See? That's way too technical for me.
